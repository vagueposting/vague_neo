          <h2>welcome!</h2>
          <p>hi, viewer, and welcome to <b>summer snow</b>!</p>
          <p>
            first things first, i go by many names. check the ABOUT link above
            to learn more about the webmaster.
          </p>
          <p>
            i use this site to archive to and link to my work. and also so i can
            build shrines to the stuff i love. i have a lot of creative material
            and it would be a shame to put them in all in the extremely
            transient land of social media.
          </p>
          <p>
            sorry if this place looks downright hideous. <s>as you can see,
            i&rsquo;m no good with html. promise you that i&rsquo;m just
            frankensteining the code i see to make something relatively
            servicable. i would LOVE to say that i made this whole site from
            scratch but sadly that's not the case haha</s> in december of 2024,
            i picked up <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard">
            the odin project</a>&rsquo;s programming classes, which pushed me 
            to revitalize this dinky website.
          </p>

          <h2>what you&rsquo;ll find here</h2>
          <p>
            like i said earlier, i use this website to archive my works and collate things which exist on otherwise disparate websites. i also use this to host small web apps that i am particularly proud of.
          </p>

          <p>i like to think that the website on its own is <b>pg-13</b>, as are most of the works that will be published. r-15 works will come with a warning.</p>

          <p>
            i develop games on <a href="https://twinery.org">twine</a> <a href="https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/">sugarcube</a> as a hobby. once i&rsquo;ve learned what i need to learn on javascript i&rsquo;ll probably shift slightly towards python so that i can figure out ren'py.
          </p>

          <p>
            i don't exactly have a set theme for this website. if you're here by
            2026 and there&rsquo;s junk like air fryer chicken recipes, updates on my 
            projects, or articles about <i>arknights</i>, then i am so sorry. 
            (i am not sorry.)
          </p>
